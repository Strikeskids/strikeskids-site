title: Free Domains for Us

Apparently, Carnegie Mellon has a lot of IPv4 addresses reserved for them. They have so many, that they give each student a dedicated static IP for all of their devices. I mean, if you have that many IPs, what else are you going to do with them?

In any case, the situation where every device has their own IP is very interesting. If everyone has their own IP, then why not give them their own subdomain as well? I recently discovered that all of the devices on the CMU network (to my knowledge) have their own subdomain under `wv.cc.cmu.edu`, unless they already are called something else.

That means, instead of having to lookup my IP, I can just call my devices by name. Pretty useful!
