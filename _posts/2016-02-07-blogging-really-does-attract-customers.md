title: Blogging Really Does Attract Customers
--- 

EDIT: Replaced the original [FOQ link][1] with internet archive.

I've read several times about how companies start blogs to attract interest in their product. If a company writes good blogs, then it gets attention and receives more awareness about its product. I have been previously skeptical about the true nature of this claim.

I was reading Hacker News today, and I came across an article about [frequently obnoxious questions][2]. I guess this stretches the definition of a blog, because it's actually in the docs&mdash;but it was posted as an article on Hacker News.

After reading through the FOQs, which were quite funny, I was intrigued to find out more about the product of this organization. I myself succumbed to the technique, and have now downloaded [Taskwarrior][3]. It's actually quite cool. I didn't expect that to happen.
